# SSFL [Submitted to ICLR 2024]
Salient Sparse Federated Learning (SSFL) is a sparse decentralized FL training method.
Tips to run the code:

1) Go to SSFL/fedml_experiments/standalone directory
2) Choose the specific algorithm: Ex- SSFL
3) Submit the batch file to run:
    3.1) cifar10ssfldir.sh (For CIFAR 10 with Dirichlet distribution)
    3.2) cifar10ssflpart.sh (For CIFAR 10 with pathological partition)
4) Specify all specs inside the batch file
